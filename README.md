# Deep Research Service

> AI-powered deep research using multi-agent workflows

An intelligent research system that conducts structured, comprehensive research using specialized AI agents. Built with [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) for [Wepoint](https://www.wepoint.com/) as an internal research tool.

**Current Status:** Phase 1 POC ✅ (Functional prototype)

## What It Does

Conducts deep research by orchestrating four specialized AI agents through a structured workflow:

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌───────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│  Planning   │ ───> │  Gathering   │ ───> │ Synthesis │ ───> │ Verification │
│   Agent     │      │  (Parallel)  │      │   Agent   │      │    Agent     │
│             │      │              │      │           │      │              │
│   Claude    │      │    Gemini    │      │  Claude   │      │   Claude     │
└─────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └───────────┘      └──────────────┘
      │                     │                     │                    │
      v                     v                     v                    v
  Research Plan       Web Searches        Research Report      Quality Check
  (1-5 steps)         (Parallel)          (Synthesized)        (Validated)
```

**Example:** Ask "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?" and receive a comprehensive research report with citations, key findings, and quality validation—all in under 2 minutes.

```

**Response:** Full `ResearchResult` JSON with plan, search results, report, validation, and timings (30-180s)

### Option 2: CLI (POC Reference)

```bash
# Run research via CLI
python -m research.run_research "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"

# Output saved to research/outputs/research_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json
cat research/outputs/research_*.json | jq '.report.key_findings'
```

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/research` | POST | Execute research workflow (30-180s) |
| `/health` | GET | Service health check |
| `/health/liveness` | GET | Kubernetes liveness probe |
| `/health/readiness` | GET | Kubernetes readiness probe |

**Request body:**
```json
{"query": "Your research question here"}
```

**Response:** `ResearchResult` with plan, search_results, report, validation, timings

## How It Works

### 4-Phase Workflow

#### 1. Planning Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Input:** Research query
**Output:** Structured research plan with 1-5 targeted search steps

Creates a strategic research plan by:
- Breaking down the query into logical search components
- Identifying different angles to explore
- Prioritizing depth over breadth
- Providing clear purpose for each search step

#### 2. Gathering Agent (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
**Input:** Search steps from planning phase
**Output:** Search results with citations and key findings

Executes web searches in parallel using PydanticAI's built-in `WebSearchTool`:
- Searches 1-5 queries simultaneously (5x faster than sequential)
- Extracts facts, statistics, and insights
- Collects source URLs for citation
- Cost-optimized: Gemini Flash is 10x cheaper than Claude

#### 3. Synthesis Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Input:** All search results + original query
**Output:** Coherent research report

Combines findings into a structured report:
- Identifies patterns and themes across sources
- Presents clear key findings
- Maintains complete source attribution
- Acknowledges limitations and gaps

#### 4. Verification Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Input:** Synthesized research report
**Output:** Quality validation with confidence score

Validates research integrity:
- Checks internal consistency (no contradictions)
- Assesses source quality and diversity
- Verifies all claims are backed by sources
- Provides confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- Recommends improvements if needed

### Multi-Model Strategy

We use different LLM models optimized for different tasks:

| Phase | Model | Why? |
|-------|-------|------|
| Planning | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Complex reasoning, strategic thinking |
| Gathering | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Fast parallel execution, 10x cheaper |
| Synthesis | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Deep analysis, coherent writing |
| Verification | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Critical evaluation, fact-checking |

**Cost optimization:** A typical research workflow costs ~$0.30-$0.50 by using Gemini for parallel searches while reserving Claude for reasoning-heavy tasks.

### Example Output Structure

```json
{
  "query": "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?",
  "plan": {
    "executive_summary": "Research quantum computing breakthroughs...",
    "web_search_steps": [
      {
        "search_terms": "quantum computing breakthroughs 2025",
        "purpose": "Identify recent major advances"
      }
    ]
  },
  "search_results": [
    {
      "query": "quantum computing breakthroughs 2025",
      "findings": ["IBM announces 1000+ qubit processor...", "..."],

    }
  ],
  "report": {
    "title": "Latest Developments in Quantum Computing",

    ],
    "sources": ["https://...", "..."],
    "limitations": "Most advances are still in research phase..."

  }
}
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Multi-agent workflow:** Separates concerns (planning, gathering, synthesis, verification) for better quality and maintainability

2. **Parallel execution:** Independent searches run concurrently using `asyncio.TaskGroup`, reducing total time by 5-10x

3. **Type safety:** All data validated with Pydantic models—catches errors at runtime before they propagate

4. **Lazy initialization:** Agents created on-demand to avoid requiring API keys for code quality tools

5. **Cost optimization:** Strategic model selection balances quality and cost (Gemini for volume, Claude for reasoning)

## Development

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Set up Python 3.12+ environment
just init

# Sync dependencies
just sync
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
just format

# Lint and auto-fix issues
just lint

# Type check with mypy
just type-check

# Run tests (80% coverage required)
just test

# Run all quality checks
just validate-branch
```

### Development Workflow

The project follows production-first development practices:

- **Type safety:** Strict mypy type checking on all code
- **Test coverage:** 80% minimum coverage enforced
- **Code quality:** Automated formatting (ruff) and linting
- **Git workflow:** Feature branches with PR reviews (no direct commits to main)

### Testing

```bash
# Run standard test suite (excludes integration tests)
just test

# Run only unit tests
just test-unit

# Run all tests including integration
just test-all
```

**Test naming convention:** All tests follow `test__<what>__<expected>` pattern

Example: `test__plan_agent__creates_valid_research_plan`
